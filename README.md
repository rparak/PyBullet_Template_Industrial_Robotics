## Project Description
The project focuses on a straightforward illustration of how to use a PyBullet physics simulation environment. The primary purpose of the project was to present a simulation of robotic structures that are part of the Industry 4.0 Cell (I4C) at the Institute of Automation and Computer Science, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Brno University of Technology.

For information about the PyBullet physics simulation environment, please visit the [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) website.

The repository also includes libraries for transformation and trajectory generation, as well as project-related functions. See the links provided below.

[/rparak/Trajectory_Generation](https://github.com/rparak/Trajectory_Generation)

The project will largely serve as a template for future solutions to more complex problems (inverse kinematics, motion planning, intelligent grasping, and so on).

## Simple Demonstration: Mechanism

A simple demonstration of how to work with a designed class to control the mechanism in the PyBullet environment is provided in the evaluation folders.

**1\ A program to test the functionality of the designed class.**

```bash
$ ..\PyBullet_Template_Industrial_Robotics\src\Evaluation\Environment> python3 test_mechanism.py
```

</p>

**2\ A program that demonstrates simple trajectory generation in the PyBullet environment using a designed class.**

```bash
$ ..\PyBullet_Template_Industrial_Robotics\src\Evaluation\Control> python3 test_mechanism.py
```
