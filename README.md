## Project Description
The project focuses on a simple demonstration of how to work with a PyBullet physics simulation environment. The primary goal of the project was to present a simulation of robotic structures that are part of the Industry 4.0 Cell (I4C) at the Institute of Automation and Computer Science, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Brno University of Technology.

For information about the PyBullet physics simulation environment, please visit the [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) website.

The repository also contains libraries, such as transformation and trajectory generation, along with the necessary project-related functions. See links below.

[/rparak/Trajectory_Generation](https://github.com/rparak/Trajectory_Generation)

The project will primarily be used as a template for the solution of the more complex problems in the future.

## Simple Demonstration: Mechanism

A simple demonstration of how to work with a designed class to control the mechanism in the PyBullet environment is provided in the evaluation folders.

**1\ A program to test the functionality of the PyBullet environment for controlling the mechanism structure.**

```bash
$ ..\PyBullet_Template_Industrial_Robotics\src\Evaluation\Environment> python3 test_mechanism.py
```

**2\  A program that demonstrates how to work with a specific class to control a mechanism in PyBullet environment.**

```bash
$ ..\PyBullet_Template_Industrial_Robotics\src\Evaluation\Control> python3 test_mechanism.py
```

## Simple Demonstration: Robotic Arm

A simple demonstration of how to work with a designed class to control the mechanism in the PyBullet environment is provided in the evaluation folders.

**1\ A program to test the functionality of the PyBullet environment for controlling the robot structure.**

```bash
$ ..\PyBullet_Template_Industrial_Robotics\src\Evaluation\Environment> python3 test_robot.py
```

**2\ A program that demonstrates how to work with a specific class to control a robotic arm in PyBullet environment.**

```bash
$ ..\PyBullet_Template_Industrial_Robotics\src\Evaluation\Control> python3 test_robot.py
```
