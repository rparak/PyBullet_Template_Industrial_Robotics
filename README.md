## Simple Demonstration: Mechanism

A simple demonstration of how to work with a designed class to control the mechanism in the PyBullet environment is provided in the evaluation folders.

**1\ A program to test the functionality of the PyBullet environment for controlling the mechanism structure.**

```bash
$ ..\PyBullet_Template_Industrial_Robotics\src\Evaluation\Environment> python3 test_mechanism.py
```

**2\  A program that demonstrates how to work with a specific class to control a mechanism in PyBullet environment.**

```bash
$ ..\PyBullet_Template_Industrial_Robotics\src\Evaluation\Control> python3 test_mechanism.py
```

## Simple Demonstration: Robotic Arm

A simple demonstration of how to work with a designed class to control the mechanism in the PyBullet environment is provided in the evaluation folders.

**1\ A program to test the functionality of the PyBullet environment for controlling the robot structure.**

```bash
$ ..\PyBullet_Template_Industrial_Robotics\src\Evaluation\Environment> python3 test_robot.py
```

**2\ A program that demonstrates how to work with a specific class to control a robotic arm in PyBullet environment.**

```bash
$ ..\PyBullet_Template_Industrial_Robotics\src\Evaluation\Control> python3 test_robot.py
```
